TODO list, backlog.

Most important item comes first. Hm, not really.

    o Import of GPX-files
      - allow a "merge"- and a replace mode
    o Export to GPX-file
      - display the center-cache (or coordinates) as info
      - limit by number
      - limit by maximum distance
    o Cache details
    o Allow to delete filtered/unfiltered geocaches
    o Allow to delete a dedicated geocache
    o Table filter: for D and T implement an exact match
    o Progress bar for long lasting operations? E.g. stream a GPX-export?
    o Status line
      - idea: allow to reset the filer from the status line
        (e.g. popup menu)
    o Preferences, e.g homezone, height of map, ...
      - make menu sticky
      - make status line optional
      - make console optional
    o More work on map, dedicated icons, etc.
    o Option to display 161m circles on the map
      - switch to detailed view, i.e. display only one cache and
        its waypoints
    o Console (configurable, delete all entries, ...)
    o Use https for map tiles
    o Add more info logs, e.g. when reading a DB, exporting, etc
    o Catch exceptions in case DB-access fails
    o Optimization, e.g. cache DB-tables for owner, attributes, etc
    o Optimization, e.g. limit the number of markers on the map, etc
    o Implement DB-upgrade into the app
    o Maintenance for DB, e.g. check for dead entries, "compress" DB
    o Special fields per geocache:
      - date of last update (used to cleanup the DB)
      - modified coordinates (use this as a filter criteria as well)

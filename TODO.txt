TODO list, backlog.

Most important item comes first. Hm, not really.

    o Filter: The settings for the default filter should not
      be reset when called another time
    o Filter: a Reset-to-default button
    o Manage-Filter: reapply the current filter after the modal
      is closed
    o Manage-Filter: Confirmation dialog for delete operation
    o Import of GPX-files
      - allow a "merge"- and a replace mode
    o Export to GPX-file
      - display the center-cache (or coordinates) as info
      - limit by number
      - limit by maximum distance
    o Allow to delete filtered/unfiltered geocaches
    o Allow to delete a dedicated geocache
    o Status line
      - idea: allow to reset the filer from the status line
        (e.g. popup menu)
    o Preferences, e.g homezone, height of map, ...
      - make status line optional
      - make console optional
    o Console (configurable, delete all entries, ...)
    o Use https for map tiles
    o Add more info logs, e.g. when reading a DB, exporting, etc
    o Catch exceptions in case DB-access fails
    o Implement DB-upgrade into the app
    o Maintenance for DB, e.g. check for dead entries, "compress" DB
    o Special fields per geocache:
      - date of last update (used to cleanup the DB)
    o Waypoint not yet treated at all
    o Support user defined notes per geocache
    o Map: provide more indications per geocache, e.g. found, owned, disabled 
    o Add a route planer, e.g. by selecting dedicated geocaches
